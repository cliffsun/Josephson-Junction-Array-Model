# Simulation-of-Non-Ideal-SQUIDs
This code describes the behavior of the current in a SQUID (Super Conducting Quantum Interference Devices) when subject to a quantized magnetic flux.

The array "arrayOfJunctions" signify where each Josephson Junction is located (and thus where current is flowing). 

If the array is as follows: [0, 0.25, 0.5, 1] -> that means that current is flowing from 0 - 0.25 and 0.5 - 1. The space in between 0.25 and 0.5 shows where current _isn't_ flowing.

Any questions about the code: you can contact me @ cliffxs2@illinois.edu
