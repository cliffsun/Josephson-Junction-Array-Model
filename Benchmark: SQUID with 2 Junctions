If you put in the array -> [0, 0.001, 0.999, 1] -> the program should output a function exactly like 2|cos(x)|; with the function reaching a minimum every half integer value of the magnetic flux quanta. 

If not, you can contact me @cliffxs2@illinois.edu with your issue and I'll attempt to help you troubleshoot your problem.
